# Email validation libraries

Due to Mailersend (used for sending emails) not including email validation in their free plan, I needed another way to validate emails for free.
Unfortunately basically all services allow only 100 verifications per month maximum, most are lower than that even.

I settled on myEmailVerifier, which allows 100 free validations per day.
